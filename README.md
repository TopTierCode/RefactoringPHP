# Refactoring PHP Edition

This project is based on the
book [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (Second Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0134757599)
by [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler).

The goal of this project is not to rewrite that book nor to translate the entire book to PHP. Rather, it is to convert
the catalog of that book into PHP to assist other developers in understanding. To reiterate, for this project to be
useful, buy the book!

This project is not endorsed by Martin Fowler in any way.

## The Catalog

The refactors are all named in the same format as in the book, and the filename matches up to the page number that the
refactor is found on. Some items are broken into folders rather than individual files when a refactor is larger than a
single example.
